Too many people do not bother to read the listing description, and I have wasted too much time trying to track down these preferences. If you want a different order, if you&#39;d like the symbols in a row, or if you&#39;d just like a different band color, PLEASE MESSAGE ME. If I do not receive a message with your order, I will assume you want the default option, and that&#39;s what you will get.**\r\n\r\nLooking for a cool piece to show off at FNM (Friday Night Magic) or maybe a gift for your favourite Magic player? These classy and fun engraved rings are perfect for everyday wear, are subtle enough to wear to school or work, and will stand up to the most strenuous shuffling!\r\n\r\nThese rings are available in US whole sizes 3-16 and in 6mm and 8mm widths. Sizes 3-9 are available in 6mm, and sizes 8-16 are available in 8mm. There is an overlap with sizes 8 and 9, so if you wear one of those sizes, you get to choose between two different widths! A wider band means a larger mana symbol.\r\n\r\nThe default band for these rings is brown stainless steel, inspired by the colour of the back of the cards, though I offer other color bands for certain styles (black band for black mana, blue band for blue mana), which you can see in the 3rd photo. If you would like something different from the options I&#39;ve offered, just message me! I am very happy to make you a custom ring! \r\n\r\nEach of these rings is engraved by hand with an engraving tool, and each features a mana symbol from the game. No digital copying is involved; I draw every symbol on the ring freehand before engraving over it. I can engrave multiple symbols on your ring! For an example, the 4th photo shows a Bant ring that I made for my fianc\u00e9. Just select the 2-, 3-, 4-, or 5-symbol option and message me about placing (either all in a row like the ring in the picture or equally spaced around the band) and which symbols you&#39;d like! For further customization, you can add a special message inside the band for only $1! Just go to this listing: https:\/\/www.etsy.com\/listing\/194186015\/add-inner-engraving-to-any-stainless\r\n\r\nFor only an extra $3, I can add a pop of colour with an alcohol-based ink. The ink is protected with two coats of a glaze specially formulated for use on metals, and one coat of a high gloss finish to make it shine, since the metal glaze dries to a rather unattractive matte finish. I have personally tested the prototype of these rings to ensure that they will stand up to everyday wear, including several handwashings and a few cumulative hours of dishwashing! The finish can chip, though, so I advise against punching brick walls or wearing the ring while using abrasive chemicals or doing serious yardwork.","creation_tsz":1444217405,"ending_tsz":1454848205,"original_creation_tsz":1406912598,"last_modified_tsz":1444217405,"price":"7.00","currency_code":"USD","quantity":61,"tags":["Magic","MTG","bitcoin","Magic the Gathering","mana","skull","fire","tree","water","sun","card","game","geek"],"category_path":["Jewelry","Ring"],"category_path_ids":[68887482,69152047],"materials":["stainless steel","alcohol ink","metal glaze","high gloss finish","pocket engraver"],"shop_section_id":13837938,"featured_rank":null,"state_tsz":1444084617,"url":"https:\/\/www.etsy.com\/listing\/198424003\/magic-the-gathering-mana-symbol-engraved?utm_source=theironyardteaching&utm_medium=api&utm_campaign=api","views":14785,"num_favorers":1121,"shipping_template_id":1263338326,"processing_min":3,"processing_max":5,"who_made":"i_did","is_supply":"false","when_made":"made_to_order","item_weight":null,"item_weight_units":null,"item_length":null,"item_width":null,"item_height":null,"item_dimensions_unit":null,"is_private":false,"recipient":null,"occasion":null,"style":null,"non_taxable":false,"is_customizable":true,"is_digital":false,"file_data":"","language":"en-US","has_variations":true,"taxonomy_id":1231,"taxonomy_path":["Jewelry","Rings"],"used_manufacturer":false,"Images":[{"listing_image_id":634732432,"hex_code":"8C7057","red":140,"green":112,"blue":87,"hue":28,"saturation":37,"brightness":54,"is_black_and_white":false,"creation_tsz":1406912598,"listing_id":198424003,"rank":1,"url_75x75":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/041\/0\/8242905\/il_75x75.634732432_o84v.jpg","url_170x135":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/041\/0\/8242905\/il_170x135.634732432_o84v.jpg","url_570xN":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/041\/0\/8242905\/il_570xN.634732432_o84v.jpg","url_fullxfull":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/041\/0\/8242905\/il_fullxfull.634732432_o84v.jpg","full_height":1125,"full_width":1500},{"listing_image_id":634847307,"hex_code":"69523D","red":105,"green":82,"blue":61,"hue":29,"saturation":41,"brightness":41,"is_black_and_white":false,"creation_tsz":1406912598,"listing_id":198424003,"rank":2,"url_75x75":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/038\/0\/8242905\/il_75x75.634847307_tns7.jpg","url_170x135":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/038\/0\/8242905\/il_170x135.634847307_tns7.jpg","url_570xN":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/038\/0\/8242905\/il_570xN.634847307_tns7.jpg","url_fullxfull":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/038\/0\/8242905\/il_fullxfull.634847307_tns7.jpg","full_height":1125,"full_width":1500},{"listing_image_id":634732590,"hex_code":"797761","red":121,"green":119,"blue":97,"hue":55,"saturation":19,"brightness":47,"is_black_and_white":false,"creation_tsz":1406912598,"listing_id":198424003,"rank":3,"url_75x75":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/040\/0\/8242905\/il_75x75.634732590_q74f.jpg","url_170x135":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/040\/0\/8242905\/il_170x135.634732590_q74f.jpg","url_570xN":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/040\/0\/8242905\/il_570xN.634732590_q74f.jpg","url_fullxfull":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/040\/0\/8242905\/il_fullxfull.634732590_q74f.jpg","full_height":1125,"full_width":1500},{"listing_image_id":634732376,"hex_code":"917E66","red":145,"green":126,"blue":102,"hue":33,"saturation":29,"brightness":56,"is_black_and_white":false,"creation_tsz":1406912598,"listing_id":198424003,"rank":4,"url_75x75":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/033\/0\/8242905\/il_75x75.634732376_23mk.jpg","url_170x135":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/033\/0\/8242905\/il_170x135.634732376_23mk.jpg","url_570xN":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/033\/0\/8242905\/il_570xN.634732376_23mk.jpg","url_fullxfull":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/033\/0\/8242905\/il_fullxfull.634732376_23mk.jpg","full_height":960,"full_width":1280}],"Shop":{"shop_id":8242905,"shop_name":"SculptRenaissance","user_id":34451228,"creation_tsz":1371085330,"title":"Custom Dolls, Miniatures, Sterling Silver Jewelry, and Engraved Stainless Steel Rings","announcement":"PLEASE READ THE LISTING DESCRIPTION COMPLETELY.

The best way to contact me is through Etsy, as it keeps all of my correspondence and orders together. \n\nFAQ:\n\nNot that anyone actually reads this stuff, but I may as well...\n\n\u2022Do you offer half sizes?\n\nNo, I do not. This should be clear in the listing description when I state that the rings are available in whole sizes 3-16. My ring blank supplier does not offer half sizes, so I cannot buy them. \n\n\u2022Will the ring turn my finger green?\n\nAbsolutely not. Stainless steel and sterling silver do not turn fingers green. I do not work with fake metals or cheap crap. \n\n\u2022How often do you mail?\n\nNo one actually asks this, but I can put it here. I usually mail Wednesday evenings after my choir rehearsal and Sunday mornings after Mass since my local post office is quite close to my church and is open 24\/7. I also mail on random weekdays when I have international orders since those must be handled by a postal worker. \n\n\u2022&quot;When is this thing gunna b shipped&quot;\n\nPlease do not message me with such abysmal grammar. Bear in mind that Etsy does not account for multiple items, Sundays, or business holidays when generating shipping dates. I&#39;ve had orders that were scheduled to ship *on Christmas Day.* Granted, I did actually ship items on Christmas Day, but I had a ton of orders that I needed to get out. I do my best to ship items in a timely manner, but sometimes life happens. I am not Amazon; I am one person. Sometimes I am away for a convention. Sometimes I am sick and cannot move. Sometimes it&#39;s snowing heavily and I&#39;m not willing to risk my life over a $5 ring. Sometimes I have too many orders to make in one day and have to wait a day or two to get to the post office because I&#39;m not driving all the way out there every day. \n\nIf you need an order shipped by a certain date, YOU NEED TO TELL ME. I am not psychic, and I can&#39;t guess that you need something for a proposal or for your BFF&#39;s birthday. If I&#39;m swamped, sick, or avoiding inclement weather, your item might not arrive in time if you don&#39;t tell me. If I know the deadline, I&#39;ll make your ring as soon as I can once I get the order. I&#39;ll leave my apartment at an odd time once the snow stops. If I&#39;m violently ill, I can have my fianc\u00e9 mail it for me. I can&#39;t accommodate you if I don&#39;t know, though. \n\nAnd please don&#39;t ask me when your item will ship because you&#39;re &quot;excited.&quot; I&#39;m grateful that you like my jewelry, I really am, but I often have anywhere from five to twenty customers or more to deal with at one time. Fluffy messages like that take away valuable time I need to fill orders and also increase my anxiety. \n\n\u2022There are scratches all over my inked ring, and I just got it! What happened?\n\nThese are not scratches. These are harmless cracks in the top coat of finish. The top coat is bonded to the lower coats which have no cracks, and should not come off with normal wear. This is caused by low humidity, and I have no idea how to fix the problem since it seems to occur at random. I live in a studio apartment and run my humidifier at full blast. My work station is very close to the humidifier, and I have attempted to combat the cracking by setting the rings to dry next to the humidifier. Sometimes it works; sometimes it doesn&#39;t. It&#39;s completely hit or miss. The finish might come out perfectly with an inside humidity of 40% and might be full of cracks at almost 50%. Sometimes rings come out fine and remain crack-free for an entire day before I package them, and they somehow develop cracks en route. If you&#39;re concerned about this, please wait until the spring to order an inked ring. \n\nThe cracks are purely cosmetic. One of my prototypes developed cracks, and I wear it constantly for testing purposes. This ring has ink all around the band, and it is still intact. The cracks are only noticeable upon close scrutiny, and they are practically invisible on the darker rings. They are most obvious on the lighter rings: silver, gold, and rose gold. If I catch that a ring has cracks in its finish before mailing, I apply a fourth coat of protective finish just to be safe, though it really is not necessary from my tests. Again, if this is a concern of yours, please wait until the spring to order a ring with an inked design. This obviously does not affect rings with a plain engraving. If you are upset about receiving a ring with cracks in the finish after 27 January 2015, I am not responsible. The information is right here. UPDATE: I have recently discovered that the problem was due to old finish. I had my bottle of high gloss finish for three years. Sometimes, chemicals can change over time. This problem has been ELIMINATED. If you placed your order after February 5th, 2015, this information does not apply to you. Your ring should not have any cracks, and it should be next to impossible for you to remove the finish. \n\n\u2022I picked at the design on my ring and the ink came off!! You obviously use a sticker\/decal instead of paint!!!\n\nNot really a question, but I&#39;ve gotten this a couple of times. All I can say is, seriously, have you never used glue or nail polish in your life? Liquids dry and become solid and able to be picked off. I detail my process in the listing descriptions. I apply the liquid alcohol-based ink with a fine paintbrush, hence why many listings say &quot;painted.&quot; It&#39;s ink, not actual paint, which you would know if you had read the description. The ink is protected with three coats of finish, and it should hold up for quite a long time. I have had zero problems either with my inked prototypes (which I wear while washing mountains of dishes that don&#39;t normally get done because I&#39;m busy with Etsy and while washing my massive cloud of hair) or the ones I have given my fianc\u00e9. The first two coats of glaze are formulated to adhere to metals, and I cannot remove it (in the case of a mistake in inking or in my own testing) without deliberately scraping it or aggressively rubbing it with a pad soaked in rubbing alcohol. \n\nObviously some people are not very careful with their jewelry or have accidents. Things happen, and I am not responsible for that. The overwhelming majority of my customers have no problems with their rings, either, and I have quite a few return customers both on Etsy and at conventions, which occur annually. If you find that the finish is getting a little ragged around the edges, consider removing your ring if it&#39;s going to be in contact with water. I&#39;ve had this happen with a couple of earlier prototypes, but the ink is still present, which to me is what really matters. \n\nActually picking the finish off and leaving a negative review is absurd. That&#39;s like picking a scab and getting mad if you bleed. Also, a sticker or a decal? Really? If it were a sticker or a decal, it could be reapplied, but as it is in fact a dried glaze, it can&#39;t be. It would be next to impossible to make a sticker or decal that tiny AND get the design to line up perfectly with the hand-engraved symbol. It&#39;s certainly beyond my capabilities. Please use some common sense.
