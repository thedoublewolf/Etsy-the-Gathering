You will receive all the decals shown in black in the images above.

With a semi-permanent, pressure sensitive adhesive they can be applied to walls and most hard flat surfaces and easily removed. Suitable for interior and exterior applications with a 3-5 year exterior life and indefinite indoor life span.\n\nHere is a break down of approximate sizes in inches:\n\nLibrary icon: H: 3.5&quot; x W: 3&quot;\nGraveyard icon: H: 3.5&quot; x W: 3&quot;\nAttacking icon: H: 3.5&quot; x W: 3.8&quot;\nPlaneswalkers: H: 4&quot; max\nLife Counters: approximately 1 inch.\n\nThese decals have been designed to fit on a table measuring no less than 100cm long x 60cm deep but will fit on a larger table and still look awesome.\n\nThis set comes with a easy to follow step by step &#39;how to apply guide&#39;.\n\nMTG® icons belong to Wizards of the Coast - this is purely fan made content. \nMagic the Gathering trading card game &gt; hours of fun!\n\nThanks for looking.\n\n**Please do not try and sell this item on other selling platforms without my permission as others are doing.

I try to provide quality items at affordable prices and spend hours designing/creating listings like this.**",

"description": "Each custom token starts out as a foil MTG card\nThe Images are then printed and placed onto the striped card to create an AMAZING foiled token\nEach token is handmade and may contain nicks or scratches as well as minor scuffs or marks on the back due to the stripping process\nThese cards are NOT tournament legal with the exception of the following\nThey may be used as proxies or tokens if a judge OK&#39;s them before the beginning of the tournament\nEvery judge may have a varying opinion and their final call is what should be followed\nEach card comes sleeved in a clear pro matte or like styled sleeve\nI can also go oversized commander cards, pokemon cards or yugioh cards. May be able to do proxys of other card games if you ask. \n\nThe material used to place the picture on the card is a very light weight malleable plastic film. This allows the card to be thinner and less noticeable inside of sleeves.\nI was running this in my EDH deck with double sleeves and no one would be able to tell the difference in thickness or playability from this and a normal MTG card.  Enjoy customizing your casual decks with these beautifully crafted proxies.\n\nITEM SPECIFICS:\nSome minor blemishes on the front due to air bubbles\nSome wear on the edges\nThe back of the card has some wear from the defoiling process\nThe image label has some wear along the edges from the tight fitting perfect fit that was used while the card was double sleeved.\nDon&#39;t hesitate in asking questions if you have any.\n\n\nI am willing to commission or do personalized requests.  Just contact me via the messaging system and we can talk out how we would like to go about making tokens or proxies of cards",

These cards do not use film, transparencies, or stickers. The artwork is printed directly onto the surface of an mtg card. This means the thickness and weight are nigh the same as a real card.\r\n\r\nThese cards are fantastic for commander, edh, cube, and casual decks and are sometimes allowed in small local tournament settings.\r\n\r\nContact us if you have any questions.",

Plus, you&#39;ll ALWAYS have the perfect token on hand and keeping track of attack and toughness is now a snap!  Wipe off the old number with your finger and write on the new one.  Easy peasy!\n\nThese tokens are reusable, so they&#39;re perfect for someone who might have multiple decks that use tokens, or for drafting a set where there aren&#39;t the right tokens readily available.  \n\n\nYou could also use permanent markers to cheaply create proxies for your own power cube -- Now cheaper & with more bad drawings!\n\nI do recommend keeping these sleeved when not in play and out of humid environments. \n\nThis listing is for a set of 5.",

The shot glasses are roughly 88mm x 50mm at their highest and widest points respectively.\n\nYou can get these glasses in either the clear or coloured varieties. \nThe coloured glasses are NOT dishwasher safe, only clean in warm soapy water\n\nIf you like my store and are interested in getting free discount-coupons and offers, then please contact me to sign up to my free news letter!!\n\n\n\nNote: All of my engravings are done by hand and therefore will be completely unique. I use some of these glasses at home in the dishwasher and so far they appear dishwasher proof… however, I cannot guarantee that they will stay this way. The coloured glasses are NOT dishwasher safe, only clean in warm soapy water and take particular care not to scrub at the base. \n\nI strive to do my best for all customers, but in the event of breakage in transit, I will not always be able to afford the cost of postage to replace the item, I’m afraid that replacements will have to be at my discretion on a case by case basis. \nYou can also find me on facebook, twitter, instagram, pintrest, tumblr, and in the general blogsphere.  I love crafting projects,  especially if someone is able to give it as a gift to make a friend or loved one happy ^_^\n\nI try to appeal to the major fandoms of the internet, with this in mind it is important to note that I am not trying to claim the rights to any of them, my works are merely works of appreciation from a fan.  I am not and official distributor in any way!",

Shipping within the US always includes delivery confirmation. Customs forms track delivery for international shipping.\r\n\r\nNote that some of the shipping costs may seem high. That is because I am estimating based on the highest cost for that weight. If you live closer, the cost may be substantially lower.  If I have overestimated shipping costs by $2.00 or more, I will refund the overage to you.\r\n\r\nPlease contact me at the time of purchase if you would like to upgrade your shipping for an additional cost.  Any duties or customs are the buyer&#39;s responsibility.\r\n\r\nShipping times vary by location, but items should arrive in 7-14 days. If an item has been delayed longer than that, please let me know. No refunds will be made for 6 weeks from mailing date on international orders to be sure that the package hasn&#39;t gotten stuck in customs.\r\n",

Refunds will not include shipping, Etsy or PayPal fees. A $2 restocking fee will be charged.",

"description": "This listing is for a foil custom made Death Star magic card. It is made using an actual magic card so the back is the same as any other card. It is only for use in casual games if you want to play with it. It is in no way fragile and the image will not scratch off, even if you took a finger nail to it on purpose. Best played in a single sleeve or double sleeved deck. The card is the same size as an actual card but the sides are darker.\n\nIf you have any questions, please let me know and I&#39;ll answer them promptly.  If you have an idea for a card, or a character you would like to see have a card, let me know and I&#39;ll make it happen. I accept ideas or requests and will design the cards for free and with no obligation to purchase the card on your part.\n\nI don&#39;t do proxies of actual Magic cards. Consider this a parody shop, for people who are fans of magic and any other franchise and would like to see them mesh.\n\nI do have some alterations up in the shop for people who want altered cards, but these are not proxies.",

"description": "Each custom token starts out as a foil MTG card\nThe Images are then printed and placed onto the striped card to create an AMAZING foiled token\nEach token is handmade and may contain nicks or scratches as well as minor scuffs or marks on the back due to the stripping process\nThese cards are NOT tournament legal with the exception of the following\nThey may be used as proxies or tokens if a judge OK&#39;s them before the beginning of the tournament\nEvery judge may have a varying opinion and their final call is what should be followed\nEach card comes sleeved in a clear pro matte or like styled sleeve\nI can also go oversized commander cards, pokemon cards or yugioh cards. May be able to do proxys of other card games if you ask. \n\nThe material used to place the picture on the card is a very light weight malleable plastic film. This allows the card to be thinner and less noticeable inside of sleeves.\nI was running this in my EDH deck with double sleeves and no one would be able to tell the difference in thickness or playability from this and a normal MTG card.  Enjoy customizing your casual decks with these beautifully crafted proxies.\n\nITEM SPECIFICS:\nSome minor blemishes on the front due to air bubbles\nSome wear on the edges\nThe back of the card has some wear from the defoiling process\nThe image label has some wear along the edges from the tight fitting perfect fit that was used while the card was double sleeved.\nDon&#39;t hesitate in asking questions if you have any.\n\n\nI am willing to commission or do personalized requests.  Just contact me via the messaging system and we can talk out how we would like to go about making tokens or proxies of cards",

May be able to do proxys of other card games if you ask. \n\nThe material used to place the picture on the card is a very light weight malleable plastic film. This allows the card to be thinner and less noticeable inside of sleeves.\nI was running this in my EDH deck with double sleeves and no one would be able to tell the difference in thickness or playability from this and a normal MTG card.  Enjoy customizing your casual decks with these beautifully crafted proxies.\n\nITEM SPECIFICS:\nSome minor blemishes on the front due to air bubbles\nSome wear on the edges\nThe back of the card has some wear from the defoiling process\nThe image label has some wear along the edges from the tight fitting perfect fit that was used while the card was double sleeved.\nDon&#39;t hesitate in asking questions if you have any.\n\n\nI am willing to commission or do personalized requests.  Just contact me via the messaging system and we can talk out how we would like to go about making tokens or proxies of cards",

"title": "Custom Foil Spider Man Magic Card - MTG Marvel Avengers Crossover Parody Mesh",
"description": "This listing is for a foil custom made Spider Man magic card. It is made using an actual magic card so the back is the same as any other card. It is only for use in casual games if you want to play with it. It is in no way fragile and the image will not scratch off, even if you took a finger nail to it on purpose. Best played in a single sleeve or double sleeved deck. The card is the same size as an actual card.\n\nIf you have any questions, please let me know and I&#39;ll answer them promptly.  If you have an idea for a card, or a character you would like to see have a card, let me know and I&#39;ll make it happen. I accept ideas or requests and will design the cards for free and with no obligation to purchase the card on your part.\n\nI don&#39;t do proxies of actual Magic cards. Consider this a parody shop, for people who are fans of magic and any other franchise and would like to see them mesh.\n\nI do have some alterations up in the shop for people who want altered cards, but these are not proxies.",

This portrait is creating a setting that is perfect for a magical evening.  The spell caster is in a graveyard with her magic wand, ready to cast an enchanting spell to create beauty in the world.  The colors, setting and feeling of this portrait  are very soothing.  The soft gray tones are very relaxing too. \n\nThe prints are printed on high quality, heavy weight card stock paper, sometimes the paper will be a linen textured blend.  They will NOT have my water mark on them.  Cards come with the colorful border and regular prints do not.  The cards are folded, blank inside for you to personalize them as you wish, and come with color coordinating envelopes (or maybe white depending on the art).
